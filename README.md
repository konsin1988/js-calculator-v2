This calculator can sequentially calculate mathematical operations and work with floating point. Operations are calculated strictly sequentially, for the convenience of the future user. There is also the ability to delete entered operations character by character, with real-time updating of the result.
And the nice design with the ability to switch themes will not leave anyone indifferent.
